    <h1>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Project</h1>
    <h5>by Reece Clem, Nasir Mendez, and Marquise Allsup</h5>
    <p>We are students at Frostburg State University in Computer Science</p>
    <p>We made a project using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a US-100 (Ultrasonic) sensor</p>

  <h4>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W components layout</h4>
  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is a compact and affordable computer with built-in wireless connectivity. This computer only has 512MB of ram, so we had to be careful when programming it not to overload the ram. This computer ended up working perfect for our project and the ram proved not to be an issue.

  <p>
    This is the BatBox, a housing that we designed to contain all of the project components. This includes the Raspberry Pi, a T-cobbler, a breadboard, a USB hub for peripherals, and the US-100 sensor. We used a micro-hdmi cord to connect the Raspberry Pi directly to a monitor. The BatBox was designed to make the project look more interesting to younger people for the Focus on the Future event.

    This shows the BatBox reading temperature and distance through its sensor. The code to make this function is running on Thonny, which is a IDE that comes built in with Raspberry Pi OS.

  <p>
    This is the US-100 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. This sensor is capable of reading distance in micro-meters along with being able to read ambient temperature. Ultrasonic soundwaves which are imperceptible by human ears are sent out of the two transmitters that you can see on the front. These soundwaves then bounce off of anything placed within 14.7 feet and return to the sensor. Once the soundwaves return, a calculation to determine distance between the sensor and object is made based on how long the sound waves take to return to the sensor. The temperature is likely measured by the resistor on the back of the device. Interestingly, this 
    measurement is necessary as ambient temperature effects the speed of sound at the rate of 17% per degree Kelvin, which effects the distance calculation.
